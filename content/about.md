About Me
--------

Passionate about computers networks and specially interested in operating systems, network performance, network processing, virtualization, also enjoying some other topics along the lines of multimedia and cross-platform (web) applications, both on backend and frontend.

<br/>

I am an UNIX enthusiast whether in the OS kernel or when making (web) applications. I tend to prefer DIY approaches when building software, most of time to learn a bit about the system underneath.

<br/>

When I'm not hacking around, I do love my longboard, travelling and enjoying some good food and beers with friends!

Work Experience
---------------

While studying Computers and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro I joined Institute of Telecomunications as junior researcher. After graduate, my first job consisted of the development an HTML5 VoIP solution interconnected with an IMS network. 

<br/>

Recently I joined NEC Europe in Heidelberg, where I revisited operating systems and packet processing to apply it in cloud environments. Since then I have been focusing into improving network performance in virtual machines, and learning a lot about operating systems and the lowest layers of the networking stack.
