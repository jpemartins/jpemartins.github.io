      <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Passionate about computers networks and specially interested in operating systems, network performance, network processing, virtualization, also enjoying some other topics along the lines of multimedia and cross-platform (web) applications, both on backend and frontend.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I am an UNIX enthusiast whether in the OS kernel or when making (web) applications. I tend to prefer DIY approaches when building software, most of time to learn a bit about the system underneath.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When I’m not hacking around, I do love my longboard, travelling and enjoying some good food and beers with friends! </p>

<h2 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h2>

<p>While studying Computers and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro I joined Institute of Telecomunications as junior researcher. After graduate, my first job consisted of the development an HTML5 VoIP solution interconnected with an IMS network. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Recently I joined NEC Europe in Heidelberg, where I revisited operating systems and packet processing to apply it in cloud environments. Since then I have been focusing into improving network performance in virtual machines, and learning a lot about operating systems and the lowest layers of the networking stack.</p>
